A Megaman tribute game using a 2d Game Engine that I will be using for other games, and I may make it a working framework.

2DGE
====
This game is based around my 2DGE(2D Game Engine) that will be used to help developers make 2D sidescrollers, and maybe other types of games in the future. It has loads of features to make your game as personal and customized as you want.

Characters
----------
The Character Object is a class that has loads of different attributes of a character, such as jump height, move speed, spritesheet, size, and many more. Using this, each level can have it's own unique character to play as.

Level
-----
The Level system uses a map file(.MAP) & tilemap file(.PNG). The map file consist of a bunch of numbers put in the form of a map, with each number coresponding to a tile on the tilemap, meaning you can have an infinite number of tilemaps for different levels. The top row on the tilemap are tiles that the player can walk through, while the bottom row are tiles that the player collides with.

Enemy
-----
The Enemy class is broken atm, don't use it. :P
